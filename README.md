The world is in the midst of an **unprecedented growth of interconnected data**, and *graph processing systems* are expected to play a vital role. *Conventional graph algorithms* designed for static graphs **struggle** to efficiently handle the continuous changes and updates that occur within these networks. As these networks grow in complexity, there is a need for algorithms capable of *efficiently analyzing dynamic graph data*. Our research aims to address the challenges posed by the need for real-time insights and scalable processing in dynamic and complex networks.

However, many *dynamic algorithms* are **sequential**, tailored towards web graphs, do not utilize *reducibility*, locality benefits of SCCs, overestimate affected vertices, have *high overhead*, do not have *well optimized implementations*, do not take advantage of *auxiliary information*, and do not gracefully tolerate *soft-faults* which modern architectures introduce. Our dynamic approaches for PageRank and community detection address these issues. Our work has been accepted by the *Euro-Par conference* (1), the *ICPP conference* (1), the *Complex Networks conference* (1), the *IPDPS workshops* (4), and the *Euro-Par workshops* (2).

<!-- Key outputs from our work include the design of a **common framework for dynamic graph algorithms**, and **techniques to address soft faults in dynamic algorithms**. -->
